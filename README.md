# Respiratory-Analysis-System
Overview
The Respiratory Analysis System is a smart and affordable device that helps monitor your breathing in real time. It uses force sensors to detect chest movements during breathing and displays your inhalation and exhalation durations on a small screen. Designed for yoga, health tracking, and therapy, this system makes it easy to understand and improve your breathing patterns.

How It Works
Sensors: Two small sensors measure how much your chest expands or contracts when you breathe.
Arduino Microcontroller: Processes the sensor data to figure out if you are inhaling, exhaling, or at rest.
LCD Display: Shows your breathing state and how long you stay in each phase.
LED Indicators: Lights up to show the breathing phase (e.g., green for inhale, red for exhale).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components
Force Sensors: Track the pressure changes caused by breathing.
Arduino UNO: The brain of the system that processes the sensor signals.
16x2 LCD Screen: Displays breathing patterns and timing in real time.
LEDs: Give quick visual feedback about your breathing state.
Power Supply: Runs on a battery or USB connection for convenience.

How It’s Built
Input: The force sensors pick up chest movements when you inhale or exhale.
Processing: The Arduino uses simple rules to determine whether you’re inhaling, exhaling, or in a resting state.
Output: Your breathing phase and duration are displayed on the screen or indicated by LEDs.

Difficulties Faced and How We Tackled Them
Technical Challenges
Sensor Noise and Calibration

Challenge: The force sensors picked up noise and produced inconsistent readings, making it hard to classify breathing phases accurately.
Solution: We implemented a voltage divider circuit and applied a threshold-based algorithm in the Arduino code to filter out noise. Multiple tests on users were conducted to fine-tune the thresholds for inhalation, exhalation, and resting states.
Real-Time Data Processing Delays

Challenge: Processing the sensor data and updating the LCD display caused minor delays in showing results.
Solution: We optimized the Arduino code by simplifying the logic, reducing unnecessary operations, and lowering the sampling delay.
Hardware Integration

Challenge: Connecting multiple components, including sensors, LEDs, and the LCD, made the prototype cluttered and prone to errors.
Solution: We used a small PCB (Printed Circuit Board) to organize the wiring and ensure a clean, compact hardware setup. This improved both reliability and portability.
Limited Battery Life

Challenge: The battery drained quickly, especially during long testing sessions.
Solution: Power-saving features in the Arduino were enabled, and unnecessary power usage, like LCD backlighting, was reduced to extend the operational time.
Handling Rapid Breathing Patterns

Challenge: Detecting rapid breathing during stress or exercise was difficult with the initial sampling rate.
Solution: We increased the sampling frequency of the sensors and adjusted the time measurement algorithm to capture faster transitions.
Soft Skill Challenges
Team Coordination

Challenge: Aligning the team’s work schedules and responsibilities was challenging, especially during critical project phases.
Solution: We scheduled regular meetings, divided tasks clearly, and used simple project management tools like Google Sheets to track progress and deadlines.
Communication Gaps

Challenge: Miscommunication about technical tasks occasionally led to delays, such as mismatched hardware components being procured.
Solution: We established a habit of summarizing action points at the end of each discussion to ensure everyone was aligned.
Time Management

Challenge: Balancing the project workload with academic responsibilities was a constant struggle.
Solution: We created a timeline with milestones, prioritized tasks based on deadlines, and worked in small sprints to stay on track.
Stress During Testing

Challenge: The team faced significant stress during the testing phase when results were not aligning with expectations.
Solution: We took short breaks, delegated tasks strategically, and approached the problem step by step, focusing on solving one issue at a time.
Presenting Technical Results

Challenge: Simplifying technical explanations for non-technical reviewers was initially challenging.
Solution: We prepared concise slides with visuals and graphs and practiced explaining the project in layman terms during mock presentations.
